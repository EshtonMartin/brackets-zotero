Having an **embedded media** (photos and video) is often inflexible with a dynamic and **responsive design**.

### Embed your video like this:
{: .left}

{% highlight html linenos=table %}
<div class="icontain">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8yis7GzlXNM" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

It'll play like this funny video below! Try resizing the page!

Photo layouts are also really cool and dynamically resizable. Check out the photos/gallery section at [magiciansanfrancisco.com](http://magiciansanfrancisco.com) for a demo and see [the source code](https://github.com/strongrobert/MagicianSanFrancisco) for how.

<div class="icontain"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8yis7GzlXNM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>




## Customizing BibTeX Keys

It's important that BibTeX keys are unique because they link your Sholarly work to the Reference database.
By default BBT generates BibTeX keys with \[auth\]\[year\] format.
[BBT][2] gives you complete control over defining your own key format.
Go through the **Configurable citekey generator** section on the [Citation Keys][1] page to learn how to customize BBT for citation key generation.
